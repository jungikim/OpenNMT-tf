"PATH_TO_LIBRISPEECH" in these files must be replaced by an actual path to the LibriSpeech ASR corpus downloaded by youself.
Each line in the {train-all,dev-all,test-clean}-transcripts.txt files contains the transcript for the corresponding audio file in *-flacs.txt.
These transcripts are copied from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus for your convenience only.

Splitting of the corpus into train, dev, and test follows the original distribution, where train-all combines train-clean-100, train-clean-360, train-other-500, and dev-all combines dev-clean and dev-other.
